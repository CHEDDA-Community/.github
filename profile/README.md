# CHEDDA

Welcome to the CHEDDA Community! We are dedicated to building a vibrant community within the Solana ecosystem that values education, collaboration, and innovation.

## Our Mission

At CHEDDA, we aim to engage the meme crowd while emphasizing that the Solana ecosystem is about more than financial gain. Our goal is to foster a community that prioritizes:

- **Education**: Providing resources and knowledge to empower our members.
- **Collaboration**: Encouraging positive interactions and partnerships within the ecosystem.
- **Innovation**: Highlighting the unique opportunities that Solana offers beyond speculation.

## What We Plan To Do

- **Developer Outreach**: We organize workshops and create educational resources to support developers.
- **Sponsorships**: We sponsor bounties, hackathons, and developer grants that foster innovation within the Solana ecosystem.

## Join Us

We invite you to participate in our community discussions and collaborative events. Together, we can shift the focus from a "pump and dump" mentality to one that celebrates collective growth and well-being.
